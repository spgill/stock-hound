### Why we value your privacy
We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our user. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

### How we collect information
We ask for contact information including your email address on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry and provide updates on your selected product(s). Our website does not use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit.

We do make use of _Google Analytics_ to understand the volume and origin of users visiting our website,
and we do make use of _Google reCAPTCHA_ to verify the authenticity of users visiting our website, and
these services are subject to their own privacy policies which can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

### What information we hold
When you use the form on our website to request a product alert, we collect your email address and your IP address.

### Where we store your information
When you use the form on our website to request a product alert, we store your information in a secure password protected database. We will store your data for no more than 1 year; at which point it will be securely erased.

### What we use your information for
We use your email address to deliver to you updates on the stock level of products you choose. When we deliver these email updates, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again.

We use your IP address as a measure of security and spam prevention.

### Who’s responsible for your information
Samuel Gillispie, this application's principal developer, is responsible for the security of your information. You may contact them by email at [contact@spgill.me](mailto:contact@spgill.me) if you have any concerns about the information we store.

### Who has access to information about you
When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. The data flow is one-directional, so personal data stored in the database is __never__ exposed to other users of the application.

We use the third party service (data processor) [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to deliver emails to our users.

### The steps we take to keep your information private
The database where we store your personal information is restricted to authorized users by means of username and password. All of our passwords are randomized 32-byte alphanumeric strings, to maximize security.

We transmit all data to mailgun (which includes your email address) over an encrypted HTTPS connection, authenticated with a unique API key identifier.

### How to complain
We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact us by email at [contact@spgill.me](mailto:contact@spgill.me). We do not accept phone calls or postage.

### Changes to the policy
If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.
