Neither I, Samuel P. Gillispie II (the creator and principal developer), nor
this web application, "Stöck Høund," are affiliated in any way with IKEA
USA or Inter IKEA Systems B.V. This is a purely not-for-profit
application, designed to provide a valuable service to IKEA customers
and fans alike.

This application is operated using the same publicly available data
found on the IKEA USA website, and data provided by users of the
application. I believe this constitutes a fair use of the services
provided by IKEA Systems B.V.'s network.

This application's source code and full list of dependencies/sources
is openly available on <a href="https://github.com/spgill/stock-hound">GitHub</a> and is
published under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT License</a>. I am
not currently accepting community contributions, but it is on my radar for the future.

I can be contacted at any time by email at <a href="mailto:contact@spgill.me">contact@spgill.me</a>.
Bug reports can be emailed to me directly or filed as issues in
the GitHub repository listed above.
